Container Technology Comparison: Docker vs Containerd vs Podman vs LXD
Overview
This repository contains a comprehensive test suite for comparing four popular container technologies on Ubuntu 22.04:

Docker
Containerd (with nerdctl)
Podman
LXD

The test suite evaluates performance, security, usability, and feature sets to help you choose the right container technology for your needs.

Prerequisites

Ubuntu 22.04 LTS
Sudo privileges
Internet connection
At least 10GB of free disk space
4GB+ RAM recommended

Installation
All container technologies can be installed using the provided installation script:
sudo ./install.sh

This script will install:

Docker
Containerd (with nerdctl)
Podman
LXD
Required testing tools (stress-ng, sysbench, etc.)

After installation, log out and log back in for group memberships to take effect.
Running Tests
To run all tests and generate a comprehensive report:
./run_all_tests.sh

This will:

Execute all test scripts in sequence
Collect results in the results/ directory
Generate summary reports in both Markdown and HTML format

To run individual tests:
# Example: Run just the performance test
./tests/performance_test.sh

Test Categories
The test suite includes the following categories:

Basic Operations: Container create, start, stop, and remove operations
Resource Management: Resource limits and isolation
Performance: CPU, memory, I/O, and network performance
Build Process: Image building performance and capabilities
Multi-Container: Managing multiple containers/pods
Security: Security features and isolation
Logging & Monitoring: Logging capabilities and resource monitoring
Real-world Applications: Deploying actual applications
Storage: Storage drivers and volume management
Updates & Versioning: Image update and version management

Viewing Results
After running the tests, you can view the results by:

Opening results/index.html in a web browser for an interactive report
Reading results/summary_report.md for a text-based summary
Examining individual test results in results/raw/

Customizing Tests
You can customize the tests by editing the individual test scripts. Each script has configurable parameters at the top of the file.
Documentation
Additional documentation is available in the docs/ directory:

container_best_practices.md: Best practices for each container technology
installation_guide.md: Detailed installation instructions
test_methodology.md: Explanation of the testing methodology
